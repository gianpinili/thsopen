# The Hockey Shop hosts THS Open

This isn't just any golf torunament -- it's an opportunity to enjoy 18 holes of challenging play while supporting a fantastic cause.

All proceeds from the event will go to the Canucks Autism Network (CAN) helping to raise awareness and support for autism.

We look forward to seeing you out there and making the first THS Open a huge success! Let's make some memories and support a great cause together. See you on the green!
